roadmap is as follows:

current tasks:
	test and debug Joystick interface
	integrate embedable Webserver into SPS
	distribute different precompiled packages for the supported hardware platforms
	distribute source only package
	write IOserver to integrate slow IO devices and other values


the tasks below are already done

new stuff 1.7.3
- awl_interpreter : runtime calculations do not work due to getdate changes in compiler
- fileserv : same getdate problem
- build windows Version
- rewrite IOwarrior code
- build embeddable Webserver
- reunify code for SPS an RUN_SPS
- build unit PhysMach with all Hardware access stuff


urgent : find people which will help in that project
any help is welcome (programming, hardware/ interfacing, app examples, translation, howtos...)
my big problem is, that I have only a very limitied timeframe to work on this project.
therefor any help is welcome

1.7.1 support for the hardware, asap

1.7.2 networking support via http. I plan to implement the possibility to access
	the state of the markers via http. together with that feature I plan to
	write some JAVA applets to make nice browser controlable GUI interfaces
	for sps programs. with that feature it would be possible to build
	distributed control ( e.g. 15 small ethernet connected DIL/PC work
	together, controled and visualized by a Browser like Netscape ).

?????? 	I want to rewrite the code to be object oriented. Its not very nice
to work with a lot of global variables and stuff
