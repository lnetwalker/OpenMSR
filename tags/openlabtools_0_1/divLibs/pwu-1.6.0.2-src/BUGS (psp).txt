Known Bug on BSD:
  DSO (dynpwu) will not work on BSD but works fine on Linux 
  (date tested: Jan-Feb 2007). Reported BSD bug relating to dynamic link 
   libraries to the FPC team, assigned to Marco V.

Known Bug on Unix:
  smartlinking will not work on FPC 2.0.2 for the PWU DSO/DLL.
  smartlinking appears to work fine on Microsoft Windows for dynamic link
  libraries. If compiling the DSO/DLL on unix, turn smart linking off.
  The problem was related to finalization/initialization not occuring in the
  DSO.

Known bug: 

 FPC sockets Win32 was causing I/O errors through TCP/IP
 http.pp, smtp.pp, httptest.pp,  smtptest.pp are directly unmodified from
 the pascal server pages project and used to crash on Win32.
 
 We have found the issue that is causing this! See the sockets_patched
 directory. Sockets work if you use the patched unit. We have reported this bug
 to the fpc team too.
