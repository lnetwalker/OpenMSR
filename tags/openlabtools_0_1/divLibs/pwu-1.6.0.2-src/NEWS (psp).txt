1.6.0.2 (22/APR/2007) -L505 

 -implemented webwriteA function, allows multiple arguments and types to be
  sent to webwrite i.e. Webwrite([123, 'string', 678.9845]); 
 -added minor debuglns missing in some functions 
 -misc fixes

------
1.6.0.1 (29/MAR/2007) -L505 

 -implemented global config file capability so each cgi program does not require
  its own config file in its directory
 -added more error codes for function return values
 -misc fixes
 -misc features added


------
1.6.x (30/JAN/2006) -L505 

 -PSP runs as a DLL/DSO using ansistrings with a special memory manager
  trick. Programs are now only 35-45KB in size on linux and call upon
  the library. Compilation is faster due to this, as the computer only has
  to create a small 35KB-45KB executable with all the PSP code external held
  in a library. Library can be loaded from anywhere on the server therefore
  only one copy of the library is needed to be uploaded to the server.
  The configuration file contains the path to the library on LINE 1 similar
  to a bash script containing the path to bash on LINE 1

------
1.5.x (17/OCT/2005) -L505 

 -PWU is merged with PSP, now calling it PSP 1.5.x. The 
  developers (Trustmaster and L505) are now working on 
  discussing the project together, instead of splitting 
  immediately into two separate projects.

------
0.0.0 (6/OCT/2005) -L505

 - PWU 1.0a released, derived from the Pascal Server Pages 
   project, but with different goals and aims.

------  
1.4.1 (29.09.2005) -Trustmaster
 - fixed range checking bugs here and there;
 - improved error reporting and made PSP more verbose, new error_reporting and error_halt
 options in psp.conf;
 - added GZIP output compression support, included PasZLib library, added new gzip unit and
 gztest.pp example;
 - updated docs, added PSP FAQ and provided some information about crosscompilation.

------
1.4.0 (10.09.2005) -Trustmaster
 - Actually absolutely new PSP library. 95% code are new, 100% of docs are new.
 Too many changes to list here. See the documentation for further infomation. Here
 are just some major notes;
 - PSP2-compliant code style (though incompatible with PSP 1.3.x);
 - Rewritten and improved units are - urlenc (httpenc), substrings.
 - Absolutely new units are - base64enc (Base64 encoding), hostname (addition for sockets),
 http (HTTP client API), md5crypt (MD5 hashing), regexp (perl compatible regular
 expressions), smtp (SMTP client API);
 - Reborn (old names, new contents) units are - fileshare (portable shared file access),
 sds (SDS2/SQL table manager), web (web programming unit);
 - New docs, new logos, new license (OpenSource Artistic License);
 - OpenSource SVN development base, SourceForge package archive.

------
1.3.3 (16.01.2005) -Trustmaster
 - A small fix that makes possible using web unit outside of webserver's environment
 (of course if you don't use any CGI-specific functions from it).

------
1.3.2 (27.12.2004) -Trustmaster
 - Small bugfix in web.pp multipart/form-data handling: just one mistake didn't let
 your programs upload files. This bug presents in PSP 1.3.1 only. 

------
1.3.1 (16.12.2004) -Trustmaster
 - Fixed a small security bug in Sessions mechanism. Don't worry, it is not so terrible;
 - GET is not limited with 255 chars any more. Since this version for all Win32, UNIX and
 OS/2 platforms GET and COOKIE length is not limited.
 - Web_GetEnv functions to get the environmental variables directly in your programs.

------
1.3.0 (12.12.2004) -Trustmaster
 - Required FPC 1.9.X. PSP 1.3 uses some advanced features of FPC 1.9.4 (or higher)
 so FPC 1.0.10 is no further supported. Please make sure you have latest compiler version;
 - Extended Substrings using containing 9 most useful functions to work with AnsiStrings;
 - FileShare unit which provides file locking/unlocking/suspending functions. It avoids
 conflicts between several processes/copies of your program;
 - Web_TMail class which implements SMTP mail sending standards in Pascal. With it you
 can set message properties, attach files, use SMTP auth, etc.;
 - Simple Data Storage (SDS) 1.3. SDS has been rewritten. Since 1.3 it is thread-safe,
 faster, more flexible. Table structure is more unified. Row identifier is always [0]
 element in the array, it is auto increment and plays the key role, but you should access
 it just as other fields. No more "ByID" functions;
 - Session table is created automatically due to config in psp.ini file;
 - Session mechanism improvement: sessions have become more secure and bug-proof;
 - Fixes in documentation, docs for new units. Russian documentation is no further
 supported because documenting takes more time than programming, so it suspends the
 project growth. But we'll pay more attention to English docs;
 - Code/memory/performance optimizations;
 - Fixed several bugs in multipart/form-data handling functions;
 - New functions in web.pp: Web_RandPass (for random word generation), Web_UnsetVar
 (to unset vars). Web_Crypt is not provided any more because it is to dangerous (may
 hang the machine);
 - Probably some more bugfixes not mentioned above.

------
1.2.2 (06.07.2004):
 - This time all the changes are connected with formatted output. This update brings
 ability to format strings/output like in PHP/Perl with $variable sequences.

------
1.2.1 (28.06.2004):
 - Some tiny optimisations;

 - Fixed SubstrReplace: substring replacement is now protected from recursion.
 For example, earlier line "s:=SubstrReplace('Very ICE line','ICE','NICE')" could
 loop forever and now it works correctly;
