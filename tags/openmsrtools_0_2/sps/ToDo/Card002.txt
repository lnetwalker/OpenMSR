Allow analog inputs to be used as K values

you need to apply changes in the files: awl_interpreter.pas, fileserv.pas and edit.pas

awl_interpreter.pas
Lines:  180-212

fileserv.pas
Lines:  87-93

edit.pas
Lines:  213-225

One idea to implement this is examine wether the parameter has a character included
if yes ,a negative value is stored in par[k] as a pointer to the input which should be used.
