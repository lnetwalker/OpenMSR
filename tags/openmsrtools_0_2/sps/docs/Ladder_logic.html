&nbsp;
<p>What makes a PLC&nbsp;
special?&nbsp; PLC's are used to automate
machinery in
assembly lines. For our project,&nbsp; we use the computer link
feature
that
allows a PLC to take commands and communicate with a host computer. If
something
goes wrong with the computer link, the PLC still functions and
protecting
valuable equipment.
</p>
<p>High Resolution Fly's Eye
experiment,&nbsp; uses a <a href="tosh-t1.htm">Toshiba
T1 PLC</a>&nbsp; as part of a
steerable laser system used for
monitoring
atmospheric clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp; We use a model
TDR116-6S.&nbsp; The
PLC was
purchased as part of a <a href="intro.htm#deal">starter kit</a>.
Specifically
the PLC is used to open and close a cover that protects the a steering
mechanism
when the systems is not used.&nbsp; It is programmed to
automatically
close this
cover after one hour unless it has received and instruction from the
main PC to
keep the cover open.&nbsp; This means that even if the PC or
network
communication to the site fails, the cover will still close.&nbsp;
It
is also
used to power cycle equipment, including the laser and the radiometer.<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This PLC and most others use a
language called relay ladder logic
programming. However, if you've programmed in high level languages
before don't
be fooled by that last part. Ladder logic is not necessarily
difficult.&nbsp;
Once you get the hang of it it isn't hard at all.&nbsp;
But..&nbsp;
ladder logic
is quite different from more common programming languages such as
FORTRAN or
c.&nbsp; It's true that ladder logic uses conditional statements,
subroutines
and FOR NEXT loops but there are some very significant differences.
</p>
<p>Unlike FORTRAN or c,&nbsp;
with ladder logic, every 'rung' of the
code is
multithreaded. Normally in a programming language things happen in
order. The
command or line of code on top is executed before the command on the
bottom
until you hit the end of a loop. This is not so in ladder logic.
Everything
happens at the same time.
</p>
<p>So what is ladder
logic&nbsp; programming really like?&nbsp; Ladder
logic
programming looks, well, like a ladder. It's more like a flow chart
than a
program. There are two vertical lines coming down the programming
environment,
one on the left and one on the right. Then, you have rungs of
conditionals on
the left that lead to outputs on the right. For example:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<b>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; x0001&nbsp;&nbsp; x0002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y0001<br>|---| |-----|/|---------( )-----|<br>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>|&nbsp; x0001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y002 |<br>|---| |--[01000 TON T012]--( )--|<br>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R001 |<br>|--[D0140&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0001]--------( )--|<br>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>|&nbsp; R001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y004&nbsp; |<br>|--| |---------------------( )--|<br>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>|-{END}-------------------------|</pre>
</b>In Ladder logic programming you
do not have variables, you have
registers.
There are four kinds of registers: X's that are inputs, Y's that are
outputs,
D's that are data that can form interger, hex and real numbers, and
finally R's
that are internal relays. X's and Y's are pointers to the
actual&nbsp;
terminal
strip connectors (what you use a screw driver on to connect wires) on
the PLC.
If you energize an input, let's say 5, then X0005 will have an on
status; also
if you give Y0023 an on status then relay 23 will flick on. R's are
just about
the same as X's and Y's except that they don't point to any hardware.
They just
hold an on or off value inside of the PLC's memory. R's can be useful.
X's Y's
and R's can even hold data besides their on and off states on many
PLC's, but
personally I don't recommend it. For data like integers and hexadecimal
numbers
D's are used as their addresses.
</p>
<p>example one. The things you
will probably use the most writing
Ladder Logic
are the relay conditionals --| |-- ---|/|--- and the output coils ---(
)---.
These three things basically make up a kind of IF THEN statement. This
--| |--
means closed if energized while --|/|-- means closed if not energized.
The
output coil --( )-- basically means then energize this. So the first
rung of
example one means that if input 1 is energized and input 2 is not then
energize
output 1. You should note that on the T1, the number of a particular
input or
output is written on the case of the PLC but for T2's and for some
other more
advanced PLC's this is not necessarily the case. To find out what the
addresses
of your inputs and outputs are you should refer to the documentation
that came
with your PLC. Also, in most ladder logic programming environments you
have to
specify the address of each of your inputs and outputs before it will
even let
you start programming. [the T series can auto configure]
</p>
<p>delay timer. What this means is
that after a specified amount of
time after
x0001 turns on, y0002 will turn on. You should note that because of the
nature
of ladder logic you can not simply put a timer attached directly to the
left
hand side without a relay conditional between it. Remember, everything
is
happening at the same time. PLC's are meant to run on their own for
long periods
of time, so you can't just tell it that 10 seconds after it's first
plugged in
it should activate something. You have to tell it to start timing after
something in the outside world has occurred, like the energizing or
de-energizing of an input.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In the code --[01000 TON
T012]-- there is the parameter 01000 that
tells the
timer to wait 1000*10ms or 10 seconds, and the parameter T012 tells the
PLC
which internal timer you want to use. Some of the more advanced PLC's
have
timers with different accuracy. Most measure time in 10ms intervals but
others
measure time in single milliseconds. You should check the documentation
on your
PLC to see if any of it's timers measure time in different units than
the
others. Also you should not use the same timer for more than one thing.
</p>
<p>On rung three of the ladder we
have a conditional statement. If the
number
stored in D0140 is equal to 1 then energize R001. If you look at the
entire
circuit you'll note that there is no where else in it where D0140 is
mentioned
and you should know that all data registers are set to 0 at default.
You may
think that D0140 will never actually reach the value of 1 and that R001
will
never be activated and that rung three and four are useless garbage
code. It's
true that during the normal operation of the PLC D0140 will never
change from
zero and the last two rungs before end would be useless. However, this
is where
the computer link function comes in. All Toshiba PLC's have a computer
link
protocol built into them. This allows a host computer, such as any sort
of DOS,
Linux based PC or even a Unix administrator with an RS232 serial port
to send
commands to the PLC while it's running and read or write values into
its
registers. This includes data, inputs, outputs, and relays.
</p>
<p>Suppose that Y004 was attached
to equipment that you wanted to turn
it on or
off at your pleasure. Suppose it was&nbsp; an air conditioner or
maybe
some
strange contraption that brought you a coke from the fridge to your
seat at a
computer. If you can write a program at your own specialized system
that can
send ASCII characters with 8 data bits 1 start bit 1 stop bit and 9600
baud rate
with odd parity, then you can manipulate the registers in the Toshiba
PLC's and
toggle d0140 between 1 and zero or 1 and any other value. See more
about the <a href="comp_link.htm">computer
link function with a sample C program written under Linux </a>latter.
<a href="Link/PLC.C">C
example</a>
</p>
<p>The final rung on the ladder
the -{END}- is basically what it says.
It's the
end statement. It doesn't really do anything except to say, well, your
done
programming. However, no program will work without an end statement and
the PLC
will ignore any code put in after an end statement. This shouldn't be a
problem
for small programs, just look at the screen and make sure the end is in
there
and at the bottom. If you happen to be making a very large and a very
complicated relay circuit your editor will likely force you to write it
in
separate blocks. Before attempting to write a very large program you
should go
to the very last programming block available to you and put the end
statement
there and no where else. The end statement can be used in debugging by
ending
the program early and disabling commands that fall after the end
statement.<b><br>

</p>
<p>Example two is a bit more
complicated than example one, but once you
understand it you'll be on your way to being able to design your own
relay
ladder logic. Rung one is especially interesting. A TON and a TOF
combination&nbsp; that lets output Y001 cycle on and off for 10
seconds
at a
time. While TON waits a given time before allowing an energized input
to affect
an output, TOF waits a given time before de-energizing an output after
it's
input has been cut off.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Let's analyze the rung. The -|
|- conditional with X001 is there for
good
programming, it isn't actually necessary in this rung but if it's not
there you
have no way to stop the oscillating of Y001 during the PLC's operation.
Now
notice that we're not allowing current to flow if Y001 is energized yet
the
output of this rung is to energize Y001. Well, if Y001 is off then
current is
passed to TON. After TON has gone through it's specified time it will
energize
Y001. Now that Y001 is energized current to the rung is cut off. Once
the
current has stopped TOF will keep Y001 powered for a specified amount
of time
before Y001 feels the affects and de-energizes. With Y001 de-energized
TON is
energized again and the cycle goes on. (You may want to reread that
last
sentence a few times)&nbsp; The output Y001 stays on for a second,
then
off for
a second continuously cycling.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Rung two shows how to set up a
push button. With a momentary push
button, the
input is only energized for a short amount of time, but often it is
useful to
keep the rung on long afterwards. What you should notice about rung two
is that
the output is connected to the left hand side twice. If either of the
two relay
conditionals are on, then the output is on.&nbsp; Notice that one
of
the relay
conditionals is the output itself. Thus if the output is powered for
just one of
the PLC's cycles (a very short time) then the output's own momentary on
state
will keep itself energized.&nbsp; You want to put in an internal
relay
conditional between the Y002 input and output or else you'll never be
able to
get it off! Well you could if you restart the PLC's program or with the
computer
link protocol.
</p>
<p>Rung three is also spread
across two rung slots but you could get it
on one
rung if it would fit ( it really doesn't all fit on one rung in the
editor).
It's basically like rung one except that between the timers is a data
statement
that increments D150 by one. There are other ways to increment a data
register,
but this is what I used. Because it's between the timers, the data
function will
only get power and operate once during the period of the cycle. Since
most of
the timers only measure in milliseconds you can use a rung like this to
measure
time in hours or days if your PLC doesn't have any function that will
do it for
you.
</p>
<p>Rung four simply turns on an
output when D150 is greater than a
number i.e. a
certain amount of time has gone by.
</p>
<p>Rung five sets D150 back to 0
when that output has been on
momentarily. In a
real application of something like this you'd probably want to use a
TOF on rung
four so that when D150 is no longer greater than 200 Y003 will wait a
moment
before deactivating, other wise it will deactivate after one cycle of
the PLC.
The PLC probably goes through around a thousand cycles per second. A
cycle is
when the PLC updates the on, off, and value states of the relays and
registers.
</p>
<p>You should notice that I didn't
just say D150=0. The = sign is
already used
in conditionals so instead you have to use a move command. The --[0 MOV
D150]--
means move the value of 0 into the register D150. There are many other
data
functions and ladder logic components that you can use. So far I've
only gone
over what I think are the most important ones. For example, the T1 also
haws its
own counters and flip flop's built in to use in your program.&nbsp;
Don't be
afraid to experiment for your self though. When you buy the <a
 href="tosh-t1.htm#starterkit">starter
kit</a> a you get PLC, a ladder
logic editor and documentation
including a list
of all of the programming components, hardware, and exactly how
everything
works.
