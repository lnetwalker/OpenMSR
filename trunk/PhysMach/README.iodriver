supported hardware plugin notes:

bmcm plugin
	supports up to 4 usb-pio devices
	notes on addressing see io warrior aection below 

http plugin
	currently you can configure *ONE* URL to read data from
	and *one* URL to write data to. In every case the ioport value
	from the port line of the config file is appended to the two urls given in initstring
	that means you can't read values from two different servers at the same time

joy plugin
	currently you can use one joystick at any joystick device
	you can't use more than one joystick
	the standard joystick driver analog should work
	Joystick Programming hints: docs/joystick/joystick-api.txt.gz
	game:	 1 0x200-207

io Warrior plugin
	you can use up to 4 io warriors. to address the iowarriors the ioport is used
	as a two digit hex number with the first digit meaning which io warrior device
	should be read and the second digit meaning which of the 4 ports should be addressed.
	there is the old nonportable linux driver iow_io_access.pas and the new portable using
	iowkit library iowkit_io_access.pas.
	the first just needs the kernel module loaded, the seond additionally the library.
	iowkit.pas is the interface file for the c library.
	you decide at compile time which plugin to use with the directive {$define newio }
	which means the portable driver

pio
	you can address any number of pios.
	currently only tested with isa bus pios.
	you need to set the program to suid root in order to have io access to ports
	bevause data is written directly to the hardware without using a driver.
	Bei der Pio ist der erste Port der Port  a, 2 = b, 3 = c und der letzte Port
	der Controlport.
	PIO: zB 0x300-303 prinzipiell beliebig

lpt
	every pc lpt port is usable
	you need read and write access to /dev/ports !
	printer: 1 0x378-37f	2 0x278-27f	3 0x3bc-3be
	beim Printerport ist die erste Adresse der Datenausgang, die zweite der 
	Dateneingang Bsp. lpt1 out 378 , in 379

Dil Net/PC
	all ports are unused dummies, there is nothing really to configure

random 
	every read generates a new random byte
	sometimes usefull for debugging
