Kernel-Driver for Kolter 1616 PCI-IO-Card
=========================================


This directory contains the kerneldriver for
one ore more Kolter 1616 pci-io-cards.

Ensure, you have a Linux-kernel greater than 2.2.x 
and the source tree of your current runnig kernel
installed. If you don't have kernel 2.6.x or later,
ensure that the link /usr/src/linux points to that
kernel source tree.

Then login as root and unpack the archive, compile
kernel driver and test-program and make
the /dev/kolter_1616.* special files:

cd /usr/src
tar -xzf kolter_1616-1.1.tgz
cd kolter_1616-1.1
make
make devices


Insert module and start the test-program:

insmod ./kolter_1616.o
or, with Kernel 2.6.x or higher,
insmod ./kolter_1616.ko

./test_1616 /dev/kolter_1616.0

Now, you should be able to meassure toggling signals
on the output-lines and recognize if some input-lines
are altered.

The modules can be installed in /lib/modules/<kernelversion>/misc
(Kernel 2.6 and later /lib/modules/<kernelversion>/kernel/misc) by
make install

Have fun!
