Kernel-Driver for Kolter ADDA PCI-IO-Card
=========================================


This directory contains the kerneldriver for
one ore more Kolter ADDA pci-io-cards.

Ensure, you have a Linux-kernel greater than 2.2.x 
and the source tree of your current runnig kernel 
installed. If you don't have kernel 2.6.x or later,
ensure that the link /usr/src/linux points to that
kernel source tree.

Then login as root and unpack the archive, compile
kernel driver and test-program and make
the /dev/kolter_adda.* special files:

cd /usr/src
tar -xzf kolter_adda-1.1.tgz
cd kolter_adda-1.1
make
make devices

If Kernel 2.6.x or later is detected, the Kernel Build mechanism will be
used automatically.

Insert module and start the test-program:

insmod ./kolter_adda.o
or, with Kernel 2.6.x or higher,
insmod ./kolter_adda.ko

./test_adda /dev/kolter_adda.0 -dacramp

Now, you should be able to meassure a ramp-signal
an dac-outputs

The modules can be installed in /lib/modules/<kernelversion>/misc
(Kernel 2.6 and later /lib/modules/<kernelversion>/kernel/misc) by
make install



Files:
COPYING		GPL-Copying License
Makefile	a simple Makefile for kernel-driver and test-program
README		guess what
kolter_adda.c	kernel-driver
kolter_adda.h	ioctl-commands and some inline-functions
test_adda.c	a simple test program


Have fun!
