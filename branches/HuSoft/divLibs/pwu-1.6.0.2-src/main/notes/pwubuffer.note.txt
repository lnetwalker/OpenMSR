 PSP 1.6.x
 ---------

 [04/MAR/2006 - L505]
  - organized the unit almost like a fake class. reference to self is now
    possible through the data record, since records don't have self.
    Note where you see "self" in the code for how the trick was done.

 [02/MAR/2006 - Tony]

  - Finished optimizations designed to minimize calls to setlength.
    Changed loops to load buffer to Move() calls
    Wrote buffer chop to be called when the length of data must equal
    buffer length.

  [12/FEB/2006 - L505]
  - Created unit to organize buffering procedures instead of hardcoding
    setlength's and etc. in pwuMain everywhere.
