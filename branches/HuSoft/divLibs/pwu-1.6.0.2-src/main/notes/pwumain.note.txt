 PSP 1.6.x
 ---------

  [4/MAR/2006 - L505]
   - Made changes so TSmartBuffer is private in this unit rather than public in 
     pwubuffer.

  [3/MAR/2006 - Tony]
   - Made minor changes in the code calling pwubuffer.
     Since the buffer may now be larger then the data it contains.
     OutBuff.Write is encapsulated as part of the buffer record. 


  [12/FEB/2006 - L505]
   - changed some of the buffering to use a new unit called pwuBuffer so we
     reuse some common procedures instead of hardcoding setlengths in the code
     everywhere.
   - changed trim functions to display a SPACE ' ' instead of nil string
   
   
  [26/JAN/2006 - L505]
   - changed GZIP_ENABLED to G_ZIP because the gzip_enabled is more verbose and
     this verbosity is not really needed.

   - changed FilterHTMLOption to less verbose alternative: HTMLFilter

  [19/JAN/2006 - L505]
   - changed ifdef position in finalization so headers are sent if gzip define is
     disabled


  [09/JAN/2006 - L505]
   - started work on PSP 1.6.X which will contain exactly the same functionality
     as in 1.5.X but will work as a dynamic link library in addition to being
     static.

 PSP 1.5.x
 ---------

  [24/OCT/2005 - L505]
   - Changed the order of substring replace in filterHTML function so that
     pound characters get filtered first, not in the middle, which could cause
     characters to slip through as double or triple filtered.

   - Changed GetWebvar_safehtml to GetCGIvar_safehtml

  [23/OCT/2005 - L505]
   - Found possible memory leak/bug in sessions, added an sds free row call

  [18/OCT/2005 - L505]
   - Added TrimBadChars_file and _dir to safely trim all bad characters from
     user input when that input will be in code accessing directories or
     filenames.

  [17/OCT/2005 - L505]
   - Merged PWU with PSP
     
  [15/OCT/2005 - L505]
   - Added GetCGIVar_SafeHTML function. This is used to get variables and turn
     them into filtered html automatically. Default security level on this
     function is level 2. To bypass default security, use GetCGIVar_SF
     The _SafeHTML prefix stands for "Safe HTML". Special characters are
     filtered for you into HTML equivilents. The SF suffix stands for
     "specify filter" and security settings.

  [8/OCT/2005 - L505]
   -Added pwuEnvVar.pp unit to project which allows easy access to CGI
    environment variables, such as ScriptName, UserAgent, RemoteAddr (IP)

  [7/OCT/2005 - L505]

   -Added WebWriteLnFF, WebWriteFF, WebFormat_SF, WebWriteF_Fi, WebWriteLnF_Fi
    functions. Created a security.txt file in the /src/conf/ directory

   -Version 1.0b released:
     more functions, minor updates, and more examples included.


  [6/OCT/2005 - L505]

   -The _S suffix has been added to some functions, so we can now specify
    security we want to use. _S suffix stands for "specify security"

     - FilterHtml has 2 security levels, with defaulted at level 2. To bypass
       the default, use FilterHTML_S(input, SecureLevel)

     - GetWebVar has 2 security levels (plus level 0), defaulted at level 2.
       To bypass the default, use GetWebVar_S(input, SecureLevel)

     - TrimBadChar has have 2 security settings, defaulted at level 2. To bypass
       the default, use TrimBadChar_S(input, SecureLevel)

     - GetCGIVar has 2 security levels (plus level 0) defaulted at level 2. To
       bypass the default, use GetCGIVar_S(input, SecureLevel)


  [5/OCT/2005 -L505]

    -Modified, converted, and refactored entire PSP project into the PWU project.
     PWU is derived from the PSP project.

    -PWU Version 1.0a released: first release.

  Developer Todo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  [L505]:

   -on certain server setups there seems to be an issue with writing to the TMP 
    directory when a user has not specified a SESSIONS PATH in the PWU.conf file.
    This needs to be checked. i.e. in the PWU.conf file if a user leaves
    the session path blank, PSP should take care of this automatically - but
    on some servers it has been reported (such as hostgator hosting company)
    that the psp does not write to the TMP directory when a user has left
    sessions path blank. On some servers it works on others it doesn't. Possibly
    a server issue unrelated to PSP, but it is possibly a PSP issue too.
    Workaround for now is to just not leave the sessions path blank in
    pwu.conf file, howerver this should be fixed if it is found what the cause
    of the problem is and why only on some servers.
    
   -Trimming null character. Is it okay to trim the null character or does
    it screw up ansistrings? Search source code for areas in question.

   -Trim functions may be moved to another unit, such as a filtering/trimming
    unit specifically for those type of functions.
    
   -security for CGI environment variables incase user injects javascript or
    other malicious junk into a HTTP_USER_AGENT string or SCRIPT_NAME
