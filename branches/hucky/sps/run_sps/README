configure run_sps with the .run_sps.cfg configuration file.
look there and in the *_io_access.pas, run_sps.pas files for help

run_sps with lp port, pio port access or on the DIL/NetPC  must be run by root
or run suid root:
chown root run_sps
chmod u+s run_sps


Now you are able to configure different devices to build up the physical sps.
you can mix all types of hardware see the concept of iogroups described later:



io_groups

run_sps is port based, 8 bits define a port.
there are io_max inputs and outputs usable ( see run_awl.h ) in the virtual machine.
where io_max div 8 = 0 is defined !

a iogroup is the assignment of a physical port to a logical group of in- or outputs
in the virtual machine. eg E1-8 in the virtual machine has the iogroup 1.

for each io_group you can define a physical port of a specific type, where the type
refers to the devicetype.

therefor it is possible to assign:
input group 1 ( E1-E8 ) -> port 0 of pio at $300
input group 2 ( E9-E16) -> port 0 of first iowarrior
output group 1 ( A1-A8) -> printer port lp0

which will result in a physical sps with 16 inputs and 8 Outputs

currently a max of 4 io warrios is defined which allows eg 64 inputs and 64 outputs

the addresses for the DIL/NetPC a set to their fixed values in dil_io_access.pas
the configuated ports are ignored. nevertheless you need to assign ports and device!

Counters
run_sps supports cnt_max softcounters. everything said about io_groups also aplies to
the softcounters. you can assign ports in the same manner than inputs.

you can configure the same ports as counters and inputs which means that eg
E1 is the same than C1.

this helps in small configurations ( eg DIL/NetPC ) where you need let's say 5 inputs 
and one counter. if you define io_group 1 the same port for the inputs and the counters
you can use E1-E5 for the inputs and E8 for the counter alias C1

run_sps should work with every ISA Bus based 8255 PIO in the address range $300-$3ff.
