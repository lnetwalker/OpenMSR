USING SPS

set the shell Variables LINES and COLUMNS to the value of
your screen/xterm etc values and sps will use the maximum possible size
e.g. export LINES=30;export COLUMNS=90
for Windows use: set LINES=25 
                 set COLUMNS=80
then resize your xterm, the values are updated automatically

just start sps and browse the Documentation there
or read/print sps.doc in German  or sps-e.doc in english.

default language for the doc is german, if you want to change it to
english docs just change the link for sps.doc to sps-e.doc




PROGRAMMING

shell variable SPSVERSION to your custom version string
e.g. if code version is 1.7.3-rc4 use something like
export SPSVERSION="1.7.3-rc4-custom"
please leave the original version string intact to show
from where you startet.
you can find the version string in the name of the source tarball
the version string is also displayed in the splash screen at start
